# pandas-challenge
The Pandas-challenge repository contains python scripts using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to analyze school/district-wide standardized test results. The purpose of the repository is to aggregate the data and showcase obvious trends in school performance which will help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

## Description of two observable trends
    Charter schools have significantly stronger test scores in both Math and Reading with a much higher overall passing percentage (90.43% Charter vs 53.67% District).
    There is a large drop off in Math scores for School sizes between 2000-5000 students. For small and medium sized schools, the avg math score was approximately 83 but dropped to under 78 for schools with 2k-5k students.
    
    
# The following summaries are provided in the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb 

District Summary
A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  -Total Schools
  -Total Students
  -Total Budget
  -Average Math Score
  -Average Reading Score
  -% Passing Math (70 or greater)
  -% Passing Reading (70 or greater)
  -% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

School SummaryÂ¶
Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:

  -School Name
  -School Type
  -Total Students
  -Total School Budget
  -Per Student Budget
  -Average Math Score
  -Average Reading Score
  -% Passing Math
  -% Passing Reading
  -% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Included are:
  -School Name
  -School Type
  -Total Students
  -Total School Budget
  -Per Student Budget
  -Average Math Score
  -Average Reading Score
  -% Passing Math
  -% Passing Reading
  -Overall Passing Rate (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

Math Scores by Grade**
A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Tables that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student) using 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Each table includes the following:
  -Average Math Score
  -Average Reading Score
  -% Passing Math
  -% Passing Reading
  -% Overall Passing

Scores by School Size
Similar to the "Scores by School Spending" table, but in this table the schools are grouped based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

Scores by School Type
Similar to the "Scores by School Size" table, but in this table, schools are grouped based on school type (Charter vs. District).
